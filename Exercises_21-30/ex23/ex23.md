### Here's what you do:
1. Go to bitbucket.org, github.com, or gitorious.org with your favorite web browser and search for "ruby."
2. Pick a random project and click on it.
3. Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and directories until you find a .rb file.
4. Start at the top and read through the code, taking notes on what you think it does.
5. If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to research later.

### Ruby File Found: [Ruby Warrior]( https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior/blob/master/lib/ruby_warrior/level.rb)
#### What does it do?
+ Creates a level class in a module for a ruby warrior game
+ Assigns a letter grade based on a percentage
+ Sets a load path for the player's current level
+ Play method shows updated game UI and keeps track of turns
+ The UI appears to be a class, and methods in this file will puts to the UI (`UI.puts`)
+ Keeps track of warrior score

### Unfamiliar Code
```ruby
def load_player
  $: << player_path
  load 'player.rb'
end
```
+ Upon google searching, it looks like `$:` is a ruby-defined global variable which is another way of referencing `$LOAD_PATH`
